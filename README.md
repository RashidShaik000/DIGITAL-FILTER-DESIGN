DESCRIPTION OF DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN: Digital filter design involves creating a digital system to process discrete-time signals, typically to modify their frequency content. This process involves selecting or designing the filter's coefficients to achieve desired frequency response characteristics like passband, stopband, and transition band behavior.

TOOLS USED: MATLAB and Python

APPLICATIONS: Manipulate signals, Removing unwanted Noise or Enhancing specific features.
